### Ayo what's up?
My name is Daniel, a noob coder from Indonesia. ~~Also known as an ordinary [NPC](https://later.com/social-media-glossary/npc/#:~:text=%22NPC%22%20stands%20for%20%22Non,thought%20or%20blindly%20following%20trends.)~~
Formerly known as RoxWithFX.

### What do I do? Well...
- I’m currently working on ***nothing***.
- I’m currently learning Javascript, Typescript, and React.js.
- Ask me about Python, HTML and CSS!
- Fun fact: The "@" symbol was almost extinct before email saved it!
